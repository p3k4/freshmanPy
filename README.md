# freshmanPy
I've upped the notch a bit! This repo is just me fiddeling with Python once again, but at a freshman-level.

In this repo you'll find a program called [c-cypher.exe](https://github.com/p3k4/freshmanPy/blob/main/Ccypher.exe)
Program code is found [here.](https://github.com/p3k4/freshmanPy/blob/main/cypher_3.py)

The kids at [Kodeklubben.no](https://oppgaver.kidsakoder.no) sure got some skills, compared to what we learned a uni - imo, this is pretty advanced and 
similar skill-level requirements.
