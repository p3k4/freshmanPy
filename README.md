# freshmanPy
I've upped the notch a bit! This repo is just me fiddeling with Python once again, but at a freshman-level.
Seemingly, the book could be a great step for anyone new to programming in general - and I don't mind using it to refresh my capabilities
as a dev. It's been years since I studied this stuff, and now months since I wrote anything in Python. Should keep a steady flow in the future..

In a few days I'll be following a Norwegian book (ISBN: 9788215034287).
