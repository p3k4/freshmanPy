# freshmanPy
I've upped the notch a bit! This repo is just me fiddeling with Python once again, but at a freshman-level.
Seemingly, a book i've ordered could be a great step for anyone new to programming in general - and I don't mind using it to refresh my capabilities
as a dev. It's been years since I studied this stuff, and now months since I wrote anything. Should keep a steady flow in the future.
