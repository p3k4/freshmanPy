For now just the assignments at https://oppgaver.kidsakoder.no/python
Listening to some awesome music as always - drinking cold beer and documenting my progress. Good times on a rather atypical Monday!

First assignment: Find the 5 errors!
I ended up finding them, and the code ran without any issue.

Made a [caesar cipher](https://github.com/p3k4/freshmanPy/blob/main/cypher_2.py) in Python. Woo! Wish I knew about this in 2nd grade - I wanted to do this so bad back then! 
I even pretenden I could write secret messages, though, it was merely in my imagination. Now I know about MD5 and PGP to name a few

Haha, I'm having a blast once again - very simple and not very good-looking code, but it works as intended. [The Cypher-code program](https://github.com/p3k4/freshmanPy/blob/main/cypher_3.py) got a tiny update, I made it easier to pick up and use. I'll add more functionallity in the next update.
